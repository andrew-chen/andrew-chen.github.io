        I'm making these pages using <a href="https://vscode.dev/">Visual Studio Code for Web</a>
        and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor">The Github Web-based Editor</a>
        and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> 
        and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site">Configuring it to publish on commit</a>
        .

        I think it is working so far. Is it?

            So far it appears to be one push behind in terms of what is up to date. I suppose that's okay.
